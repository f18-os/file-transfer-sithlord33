Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no event could have filled mewith greater anxieties than that of which the notification wastransmitted by your order, and received on the fourteenth day of thepresent month. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whosevoice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreatwhich I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in myflattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of mydeclining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more necessaryas well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination,and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual wastecommitted on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude anddifficulty of the trust to which the voice of my Country called me,being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of hercitizens, a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could notbut overwhelm with dispondence, one, who, inheriting inferiorendowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civiladministration, ought to be peculiarly conscious of his owndeficiencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver, is, thatit has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a justappreciation of eve ry circumstance, by which it might beaffected. All I dare hope, is, that, if in executing this task I havebeen too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, orby an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof, of theconfidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little consultedmy incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untriedcares before me; my error will be palliated by the motives whichmisled me, and its consequences be judged by my Country, with someshare of the partiality in which they originated.  Such being theimpressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons,repaired to the present station; it would be peculiarly improper toomit in this first official Act, my fervent supplications to thatAlmighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in theCouncils of Nations, and whose providential aids can supply everyhuman defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties andhappiness of the People of the United States, a Government institutedby themselves for these essential purposes: and may enable everyinstrument employed in its administration to execute with success, thefunctions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to theGreat Author of every public and private good I assure myself that itexpresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of myfellow-citizens at large, less than either. No People can be bound toacknowledge and adore the invisible hand, which conducts the Affairsof men more than the People of the United States. Every step, by whichthey have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems tohave been distinguished by some token of providential agency. And inthe important revolution just accomplished in the system of theirUnited Government, the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent ofso many distinct communities, from which the event has resulted,cannot be compared with the means by which most Governments have beenestablished, without some return of pious gratitude along with anhumble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem topresage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, haveforced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You willjoin with me I trust in thinking, that there are none under theinfluence of which, the proceedings of a new and free Government canmore auspiciously commence.  By the article establishing the ExecutiveDepartment, it is made the duty of the President "to recommend to yourconsideration, such measures as he shall judge necessary andexpedient." The circumstances under which I now meet you, will acquitme from entering into that subject, farther than to refer to the GreatConstitutional Charter under which you are assembled; and which, indefining your powers, designates the objects to which your attentionis to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances,and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, tosubstitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, thetribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotismwhich adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In thesehonorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges, that as on oneside, no local prejudices, or attachments; no seperate views, norparty animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eyewhich ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities andinterests: so, on another, that the foundations of our National policywill be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality;and the pre-eminence of a free Government, be exemplified by all theattributes which can win the affections of its Citizens, and commandthe respect of the world.  I dwell on this prospect with everysatisfaction which an ardent love for my Country can inspire: sincethere is no truth more thoroughly established, than that there existsin the economy and course of nature, an indissoluble union betweenvirtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the genuinemaxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards ofpublic prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuadedthat the propitious smiles of Heaven, can never be expected on anation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, whichHeaven itself has ordained: And since the preservation of the sacredfire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model ofGovernment, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finallystaked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the Americanpeople.  Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it willremain with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of theoccasional power delegated by the Fifth article of the Constitution isrendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objectionswhich have been urged against the System, or by the degree ofinquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertakingparticular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guidedby no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again giveway to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of thepublic good: For I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid everyalteration which might endanger the benefits of an United andeffective Government, or which ought to await the future lessons ofexperience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen, anda regard for the public harmony, will sufficiently influence yourdeliberations on the question how far the former can be moreimpregnably fortified, or the latter be safely and advantageouslypromoted. To the preceeding observations I have one to add, whichwill be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives. Itconcerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as possible. When Iwas first honoured with a call into the Service of my Country, then onthe eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which Icontemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniarycompensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed. Andbeing still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline asinapplicable to myself, any share in the personal emoluments, whichmay be indispensably included in a permanent provision for theExecutive Department; and must accordingly pray that the pecuniaryestimates for the Station in which I am placed, may, during mycontinuance in it, be limited to such actual expenditures as thepublic good may be thought to require.  Having thus imported to you mysentiments, as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings ustogether, I shall take my present leave; but not without resortingonce more to the benign parent of the human race, in humblesupplication that since he has been pleased to favour the Americanpeople, with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility,and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a formof Government, for the security of their Union, and the advancement oftheir happiness; so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous inthe enlarged views, Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no eventcould have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which thenotification was transmitted by your order, and received on thefourteenth day of the present month.
