WHEN, in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for onePeople to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them withanother, and to assume, among the Powers of the Earth, the separateand equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's GODentitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requiresthat they should declare the Causes which impel them to theSeparation.We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are createdequal, that they are endowed, by their CREATOR, with certainunalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and thePursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these Rights, Governments areinstituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent ofthe Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructiveof these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolishit, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on suchPrinciples, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shallseem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,indeed, will dictate, that Governments long established, should not bechanged for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experiencehath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils aresufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to whichthey are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations,pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce themunder absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, tothrow off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their futureSecurity. Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; andsuch is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their formerSystems of Government. The History of the present King ofGreat-Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, allhaving in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny overthese States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.HE has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public Good.HE has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingImportance, unless suspended in their Operation till his Assent shouldbe obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attendto them.HE has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of largeDistricts of People, unless those People would relinquish the Right ofRepresentation in the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, andformidable to Tyranny only.HE has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository of their publicRecords, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into Compliance withhis Measures.HE has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing withmanly Firmness his Invasions on the Rights of the People.HE has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to causeothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable ofAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;the State remaining, in the mean Time, exposed to all the Dangers ofInvasion from without, and Convulsions within.HE has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these States; for thatPurpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, andraising the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.HE has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing hisAssent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.HE has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure oftheir Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.HE has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms ofOfficers to harrass our People, and eat out their Substance.HE has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without theConsent of our Legislatures.HE has affected to render the Military independent of and superior tothe Civil Power.HE has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign toour Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent totheir Acts of pretended Legislation:FOR quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murderswhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:FOR cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:FOR imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:FOR transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:FOR abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouringProvince, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlargingits Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fitInstrument for introducing the same absolute Rule into these Colonies:FOR taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, andaltering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:FOR suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves investedwith Power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.HE has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of hisProtection, and waging War against us.HE has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our Towns, anddestroyed the Lives of our People.HE is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenariesto complete the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begunwith Circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilizedNation.HE has constrained our Fellow-Citizens, taken Captive on the highSeas, to bear Arms against their Country, to become the Executionersof their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.HE has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavouredto bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless IndianSavages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguishedDestruction, of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions.IN every Stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress inthe most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered onlyby repeated Injury. A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by everyAct which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a freePeople.NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren. Wehave warned them, from Time to Time, of Attempts by their Legislatureto extend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have reminded themof the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here. We haveappealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjuredthem by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these Usurpations,which would inevitably interrupt our Connexions andCorrespondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and ofConsanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, whichdenounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the Rest ofMankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.WE, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, inGENERAL CONGRESS Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of theWorld for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and byAuthority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly Publish andDeclare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be,FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are absolved from allAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connexionbetween them and the State of Great-Britain, is, and ought to be,totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they havefull Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establishCommerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATESmay of Right do. And for the Support of this Declaration, with a firmReliance on the Protection of DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge toeach other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honour.
